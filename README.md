# EE-Toolkit: Circuit & Component Calculator
**  Created by  Arzaan  **

## 📌 Project Overview
The EE-Toolkit is a modular C++ command-line utility designed for Electrical Engineering students and hobbyists. It simplifies common circuit calculations, including Ohm's Law, Power Law, and Capacitor Charge relations. 

This project demonstrates core programming principles like **Modular Programming**, **Switch-Case Logic**, and **Persistent User Loops**, while addressing real-world engineering formulas.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Ohm's Law Solver:** Calculate Voltage (V), Current (I), or Resistance (R) using the relation (V =I R).
- **Power Calculator:** Determine Power (P), Voltage (V), or Current (I) based on the Power Law (P = VI).
- **Capacitor Analytics:** Solve for Charge (Q), Capacitance (C), or Voltage ($V$) using the relation (Q = CV).
- **Interactive CLI:** A user-friendly menu system that allows for multiple calculations in a single session.

## ❓ How to Run
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++` on Mac/Linux or MinGW on Windows).
2. Clone this repository:
